# Project CO-MICRONS

Covid has almost sustained for 2 years in India and other countries. People died of panic rather than the disease itself since havoc has been created for the new covid variant "Omicron" despite knowing that it has mild symptoms and can be self-managed. Further the people are not aware of the situation and are not taking preventive measures in order to tackle the situation.  
Our website covers all age groups and it has quiz games for youngsters, in covid people are getting mentally weak and our website provides them opportunities to go through various situational quizzes and make themselves aware.  
This project also provides the live case updates of people suffering from Covid-19.  
Without going all of the hefty news and challenges being shown in advertisements and news channels, they get detailed case studies and proper citation of information without panicking.  
Covid has isolated people, but our website provides a platform to share their experience and learn about the mistakes people and not repeat them.
